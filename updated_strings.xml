    <string name="bmi_details">Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
        The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2,
        resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.

        The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese
        based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.
        That categorization is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed.
        Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30)
        ,and obese (over 30).
